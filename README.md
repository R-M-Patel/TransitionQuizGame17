#PharmGenius

This application was developed by a team of four University of Pittsburgh students in coordination with Pitt's Pharmacy Innovations Lab. This was part of a Senior Design course for our capstone requirement.</br>

It runs on the Google Cloud Platform. The application is built on Python, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.</br>

The site is live <a href = "http://aecs1980qg.appspot.com/">here</a>.
